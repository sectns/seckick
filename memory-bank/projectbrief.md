# Project Brief

Kick-like live streaming companion built with Node.js. The app surfaces live state for user-selected Kick channels using Kick’s public endpoints, supports Firebase authentication and persistence for signed-in users, and offers guest mode with cookie/local storage for the follow list. A custom HLS player (Hls.js/Plyr) plays the provided playback URL with quality controls. UI uses Tailwind with a green-forward theme without mimicking Kick branding. Chat is not embedded; instead, a button opens chat in a new tab.
