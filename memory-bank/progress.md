# Progress

- Setup: Initialized Node project with Express backend (now serving static + health only; Kick proxy endpoints removed per request) and optional `KICK_COOKIES` header for earlier attempts. Added .env examples.
- Frontend: Created Vite + React + Tailwind app (landing, follows, player). Guest mode stores follows in cookies; signed-in mode uses Firebase Auth/Firestore (guarded by env presence). Player now uses Plyr with native HLS playback (automatic quality) and chat-open button.
- Build: `client` builds successfully; root scripts run `npm run dev` (concurrently) or `npm start` after `npm run build`. Express catch-all adjusted to middleware to satisfy Express 5 path-to-regexp.
- Known issues: Kick public endpoints still return 403 from this environment without clearance; requires real cookie/session to verify live data. Firebase auth inactive until `client/.env` is filled with valid project keys (`VITE_FIREBASE_*`). Client now guards non-JSON Kick responses and falls back to mock data for slugs `ebonivon`/`eray` (optional `VITE_KICK_USE_MOCK=1` to force). Frontend Kick calls hit `https://kick.com/api/v1/channels/:slug` directly; backend has no Kick proxy routes, and `server/kickClient.js` was removed. Player now uses Plyr + Hls.js with manual quality selection; still requires a browser that can play HLS (or Hls.js) and real Kick playback URLs.
- Latest: Fixed player build path by restoring `HlsPlayer.jsx`, tightened player page slug switching so a new broadcaster loads immediately, removed Hls.js from the player in favor of Plyr-only native playback, and kept clean teardown of the video element between loads.
- Latest UX tweaks: landing auto-redirects authenticated/guest users to the follows page; follows list sorts live channels first; player list shows only live channels and auto-picks a live stream when available.
- New today: follow cards now rank by viewer count (live first) with icons for status/viewers/category, and their play action respects the chosen slug in the player. Player sidebar shows all follows in the same order (not just live), keeps the clicked broadcaster active even if offline, and the Plyr-based `HlsPlayer.jsx` now resets sources cleanly when switching broadcasters and shows an offline/loading state when no playback URL exists.
- Player quality: restored Hls.js + Plyr integration in `HlsPlayer.jsx` with manual quality selection (resolutions + auto), while keeping jump-to-live and cleanup between source switches.
